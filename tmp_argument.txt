We have now entered the most dangerous period of global instability in our lifetimes—a G-Zero world with no reliable leadership. In 2025, power vacuums are expanding, rogue actors are emboldened, and the risk of major crises is climbing even higher.
Russia and China remain the main challengers to the Western order, though they pursue their aims in very different ways. Across advanced democracies, citizens are turning against “globalism,” blaming it for rising inequality, demographic frustration, and disruptive technology. And America, the world’s former anchor, is now led by a president who outright rejects the notion of global leadership as an American imperative.
There are three ways out of this deepening geopolitical recession. First, reform existing institutions like the UN and IMF. Second, build new institutions that better fit the emerging power balance. Third, impose a new order by force. In 2025, it’s the third—force—that both revisionist powers and emerging actors are focusing on.
This is not a crisis born of a single event. It is the cumulative effect of intensifying leadership vacuum and the collapse of consensus, pushing us into an era as dangerous as the 1930s or the early Cold War.
Consider Russia: in the aftermath of a likely Ukraine ceasefire, Putin will remain the world’s top rogue actor, expanding cyber and sabotage operations against Europe, deepening ties with Iran and North Korea, and sowing chaos in Western democracies. Even the apparent “solution” in Ukraine—freezing lines with Russia in control—will only add new layers of risk and instability, forcing Europe to rearm and NATO to remain on high alert.
The bottom line: The absence of strong, legitimate global leadership is not only eroding the international order—it is setting the stage for more dangerous miscalculations and confrontations in the years ahead.
